# Zora Tip Jar

A Farcaster Frame for tipping creators with Zora coin in one click.

## What is this?

Zora Tip Jar is a simple Farcaster Frame that lets people tip their favorite creators using Zora Coins. Just one click and you're done — no need to leave Farcaster.

## Why?

Creators often post amazing content, but there's no native way to support them financially on Farcaster. Zora Tip Jar solves that, using the power of Zora's Coins SDK.
